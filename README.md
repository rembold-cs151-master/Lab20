# Lab 20 - Terraforming

This lab focused on formating strings in a nice fashion.

Instructions for what the started script should do are included in the overall lab instructions.

Follow the instructions then upload your completed script back to Github to get credit for the day.

No auto-testing is being run on this, so make sure your final result looks like that given in the lab instructions!
